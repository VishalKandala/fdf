 * (3 for vector fields and 1 for scalar fields), retrieves local DM information for both the coordinate DM (da)
 * and the cell-centered DM (fda), interpolates the corner-based coordinates (from da) to cell centers,
 * and then updates the field using the generic helper macro SetLocalCartesianField. Interior cells are
 * updated with the interpolated coordinates, and boundary cells are updated using the original coordinate data.
