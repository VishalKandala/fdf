/**
 * @brief Performs the complete initial setup for the particle simulation at time t=0.
 *
 * This includes:
 * 1. Initial locating of particles (based on their potentially arbitrary initial assignment).
 * 2. A preliminary migration cycle to ensure particles are on the MPI rank that owns
 *    their initial physical region.
 * 3. If `user->ParticleInitialization == 0` (Surface Init), re-initializes particles on the
 *    designated inlet surface. This ensures particles migrated to an inlet-owning rank
 *    are correctly distributed on that surface.
 * 4. A final locating of all particles to get their correct cell indices and interpolation weights.
 * 5. Interpolation of initial Eulerian fields to the particles.
 * 6. Scattering of particle data to Eulerian fields (if applicable).
 * 7. Outputting initial data if requested.
 *
 * @param user Pointer to the UserCtx structure.
 * @param currentTime The current simulation time (should be StartTime, typically 0.0).
 * @param step The current simulation step (should be StartStep, typically 0).
 * @param readFields Flag indicating if Eulerian fields were read from file (influences output).
 * @param bboxlist Array of BoundingBox structures for domain decomposition.
 * @param OutputFreq Frequency for writing output files.
 * @param StepsToRun Total number of simulation steps planned (used for output logic on setup-only runs).
 * @param StartStep The starting step of the simulation (used for output logic).
 * @return PetscErrorCode 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

/**
 * @brief Initializes or updates the complete, consistent state of all Eulerian fields for a given timestep.
 *
 * This function is a high-level wrapper that orchestrates the entire process of preparing
 * the fluid fields for a single time step. It follows the standard procedure for a
 * curvilinear solver: first resolving contravariant velocities (`Ucont`) and then
 * converting them to Cartesian (`Ucat`).
 *
 * Its sequential operations are:
 * 1.  Update the INTERIOR of the domain:
 *     - For the initial step, it calls `SetInitialInteriorField` to generate values.
 *     - For subsequent steps, it calls the main fluid solver.
 *     - If restarting from a file, it reads the data, overwriting the whole field.
 *
 * 2.  Apply Boundary Conditions:
 *     - It then calls the modular `BoundarySystem_ExecuteStep` to enforce all configured
 *       boundary conditions on the domain edges.
 *
 * 3.  Convert to Cartesian and Finalize:
 *     - It calls `Contra2Cart` to compute `Ucat` from `Ucont`.
 *     - It calls `UpdateLocalGhosts` to ensure all parallel data is synchronized.
 *
 * @param user        Pointer to the UserCtx structure, containing all simulation data.
 * @param step        The current timestep number being processed.
 * @param StartStep   The initial timestep number of the simulation.
 * @param time        The current simulation time.
 * @param readFields  A boolean flag. If true, the simulation attempts to read fields
 *                    from files at the StartStep instead of generating them.
 * @return PetscErrorCode 0 on success.
