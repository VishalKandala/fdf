 *                       distances are typically computed using the `CalculateDistancesToCellFaces`

 * - It is assumed that the `d` array has been properly allocated and contains valid distance
 *   measurements before calling this function.
 * - The function relies on `CalculateDistancesToCellFaces` to accurately compute the signed

 * - The `threshold` parameter should be chosen based on the specific precision requirements
 *   of the application to balance between sensitivity and robustness against floating-point
 *   errors.
 * - The function includes a debug statement that prints the face distances, which can be useful
 *   for verifying the correctness of distance computations during development or troubleshooting.

 * @brief Locates the grid cell containing a particle using a walking search.
 * @ingroup ParticleLocation
 *
 * This function implements a walking search algorithm to find the specific cell

 * location (`particle->loc`).
 *
 * The search starts from an initial guess cell (either the particle's previously known
 * cell or the corner of the local process domain) and iteratively steps to adjacent
 * cells based on the signed distances from the particle to the faces of the current
 * cell.
 *
 * Upon successful location (`position == 0`), the particle's `cell` field is updated
 * with the found indices (i,j,k), and the corresponding interpolation `weights`
 * are calculated and stored using the distances (`d`) relative to the final cell.
 *
