/**
 * @brief Computes the signed distance from a point to the plane approximating a quadrilateral face.
 *
 * This function calculates the signed distance from a given point `p_target` to the plane
 * approximating a quadrilateral face defined by points `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `v4`.
 * The plane's initial normal is determined using two edge vectors emanating from `v1`
 * (i.e., `v2-v1` and `v4-v1`).
 *
 * **Normal Orientation:**
 * The initial normal's orientation is checked against the cell's interior.
 * A vector from the face centroid to the cell centroid (`vec_face_to_cell_centroid`) is computed.
 * If the dot product of the initial normal and `vec_face_to_cell_centroid` is positive,
 * it means the initial normal is pointing towards the cell's interior (it's an inward normal
 * relative to the cell). In this case, the normal is flipped to ensure it points outward.
 *
 * **Signed Distance Convention:**
 * The signed distance is the projection of the vector from `p_target` to the face's centroid
 * onto the (now guaranteed) outward-pointing plane's normal vector.
 *   - `d_signed < 0`: `p_target` is "outside" and "beyond" the face, in the direction of the outward normal.
 *                     This is the primary case indicating the particle has crossed this face.
 *   - `d_signed > 0`: `p_target` is "outside" but "behind" the face (on the same side as the cell interior
 *                     relative to this face plane).
 *   - `d_signed = 0`: `p_target` is on the face plane (within threshold).
 *
 * @param[in]  v1            First vertex defining the face (used as origin for initial normal calculation).
 * @param[in]  v2            Second vertex defining the face (used for first edge vector: v2-v1).
 * @param[in]  v3            Third vertex defining the face (used for face centroid calculation).
 * @param[in]  v4            Fourth vertex defining the face (used for second edge vector: v4-v1).
 * @param[in]  cell_centroid The centroid of the 8-vertex cell to which this face belongs.
 * @param[in]  p_target      The point from which the distance to the plane is calculated.
 * @param[out] d_signed      Pointer to store the computed signed distance.
 * @param[in]  threshold     The threshold below which the absolute distance is considered zero.
 *
 * @note
 * - The order of vertices `v1, v2, v3, v4` is used for calculating the face centroid.
 *   The order of `v1, v2, v4` is used for the initial normal calculation.
 * - The `cell_centroid` is crucial for robustly determining the outward direction of the normal.
 *
 * @return PetscErrorCode Returns 0 on success, PETSC_ERR_ARG_NULL if `d_signed` is NULL,
 *                        or PETSC_ERR_USER if a degenerate plane (near-zero normal) is detected.
