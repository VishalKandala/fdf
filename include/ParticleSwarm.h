/**
 * @brief Creates and initializes a Particle Swarm.
 *
 * This function sets up a DMSwarm within the provided UserCtx structure, initializes
 * particle fields, and distributes particles across MPI processes. It ensures that
 * the number of particles is evenly divided among the available MPI ranks. If the total
 * number of particles isn't divisible by the number of processes, the remainder is distributed
 * to the first few ranks.
 *
 * Additionally, it now takes a 'bboxlist' array as an input parameter and passes it on to
 * AssignInitialProperties(), enabling particle initialization at the midpoint of each rank's
 * bounding box if ParticleInitialization is set to 0.
 *
 * @param[in,out] user          Pointer to the UserCtx structure containing the simulation context.
 * @param[in]     numParticles  Total number of particles to create across all MPI processes.
 * @param[in]     bboxlist      Pointer to an array of BoundingBox structures, one per rank.
 *
 * @return PetscErrorCode Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
 *
 * @note
 * - Ensure that `numParticles` is a positive integer.
 * - The `control.dat` file should contain necessary PETSc options.

 *     This invalidates any cell index that might have been loaded or defaulted to 0.
 * 2.  It sets the `DMSwarm_location_status` field to `NEEDS_LOCATION`.
